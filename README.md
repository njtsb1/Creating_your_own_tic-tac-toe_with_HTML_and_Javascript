# Creating your own tic-tac-toe with HTML and Javascript

Project developed at Digital Innovation One's Bootcamp JavaScript Game Developer with guidance from specialist [Vitor Ruschoni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruschoni02/ "Vitor Ruschoni").
Learning to build a tic-tac-toe using only HTML to structure the site, CSS to style and bring it to life and JavaScript to create all your interactions, from choosing the player, making a move and giving the game a winner. 
We saw how to create very simple projects without a lot of work, just using basic functions and a little logic!
